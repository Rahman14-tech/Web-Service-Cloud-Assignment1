Each of those matches an alphanumeric character, optionally followed by either 0-61 alphanumeric characters or dashes and another single alhpanumeric character. Finally, there is a letter-only toplevel domain name of 2-6 characters and an optional dot.

    r"(?:/?|[/?]\S+)$"                                                  # Finally, we match an optional slash or a (slash or question mark) followed by at least one non-whitespace character. This effectively makes most of the paths wildcards, as they can be anything; but because paths can container arbitrary information, this is OK. At last we match the end-of-string boundary, `$`.
